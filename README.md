# The Jolie Documentation files

This [book](https://jolielang.gitbooks.io/docs/content/) is the reference documentation for the [Jolie](http://jolie-lang.org) programming language.

To download the PDF, Mobi and ePub versions of the Jolie documentation, please refer to the related [GitBook page](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jolielang/docs/details).

## How to contribute to the Jolie Documentation

This GitBook is linked to the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/jolie/docs](https://github.com/jolie/docs).

The first step to update or create contents in the Jolie documentation is to [fork the documentation repository](https://github.com/jolie/docs#fork-destination-box).

Then, you can either update or create some content in your fork and, once done, you can [issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to include your contribution in the official Jolie documentation.

Please, find below some additional information on both how to update existing pages and create new ones.

### File structure

In the GitHub repository, the folder [documentation](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/master/documentation) contains all the documentation pages, stored as `.md` files. 

The location of the files follows the structure reported by the [GitBook](https://jolielang.gitbooks.io/docs/content/), so e.g., the page [Compositing Statements](https://jolielang.gitbooks.io/docs/content/documentation/basics/composing_statements.html) is under path [`/documentation/basics/composing_statements.md`](https://github.com/jolie/docs/blob/master/documentation/basics/composing_statements.md).

### Updating existing pages

To modify an existing page, it is sufficient to modify the related `.md` file.

In case you want to include new images in a page, we usually use (or create, in case it is missing) a dedicated sub-folder called `img` within the specific first-level sub-folder. For instance, if you want to add an image in a page under the `documentation/basics` sub-folder, you can create the `img` folder, save the image in it, and link it from the interested document.

We follow a similar structure also for archives (`.zip`) that contain comprehensive, runnable code examples, which are stored under the dedicated `code` folder.

### Creating new pages

When creating a new page, please follow the guidelines above and make sure to:

- create the page as a new `.md` file, under one of the existing first-level sub-folders (or create a new one, if necessary);

- update the summary to show the link to the newly created page. This is done by editing the [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/jolie/docs/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) file, present in the root of the repository.
