# Sessions
In Jolie a _session_ represents a communication session among the service that holds the session, and other participants. In the majority of cases, a session is enabled when a message is received on a request-response operation, and it is terminated when the response message is sent. In general, more interactions among different participants can be designed establishing a stateful session among them. In Jolie, a stateful session is always represented by a set of data which identifies it within the engine, that is called _correlation set_. A session is always animated by a specific running process in the engine. More sessions can be carried on by the same process at the same time. 

## Stateful sessions

Usually a service provides _loosely coupled_ operations, which means that there is no correlation among the different invocations of different operatons. Each invocation can be considered as independent from the others. Neverthless, it could happen that we need to design sessions which can receive messages more than once from external invokers. In these cases, we need to correctly route the incoming messages to the right session.

Let us clarify with an example. Assume a scenario where there is a service which allows two users for playing tris game ([tic tac toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)). The tris game service will keep each game into a specific session. A user can participate to different games, thus it needs to send its move to the right session for correctly playing the game. In this case, we need to route each user message to the right session it is involved in. This is solved by sending for each message an extra information, usually a session identifier. We call these kind of information _correlation sets_.

If you are curious on seeing how a tris game can be implemented in Jolie, you can find the code at this [link](https://github.com/jolie/examples/tree/master/v1.10.x/02_basics/5_sessions/tris)


## Correlation sets

Jolie supports incoming message routing to behaviour instances by means of _correlation sets_. Correlation sets are a generalisation of session identifiers: instead of referring to a single variable for identifying behaviour instances, a correlation set allows the programmer to refer to the combination of multiple variables, called _correlation variables_. In common web application frameworks this issue is covered by _sid_ session identifier, a unique key usually stored as a browser cookie.

Correlation set programming deals both with the deployment and behavioural parts. In particular, the former must declare the correlation sets, instructing the interpreter on how to relate incoming messages to internal behaviour instances. The latter instead has to assign the concrete values to the correlation variables.

In the deployment part the cset is defined as it follows:

```text
cset {
   <variable name>: <List of type paths coupled with the correlation variable>
}
```

In the behaviural part, the cset is initialized as it follows:

```text
   csets.<variable name> = <variable value>
```

A precise definition of the syntax can be found in the [section below](sessions.md#correlation-sets-syntax)

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/cset.png)

When a message is received, the intepreter looks into the message for finding the data node which contains the value to be compared with the correlation values. In the diagram above, the variable _x_ is the correlation variable and it can be found in the message of type _MyRequest_ in the subnode _x_.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/cset_messages.png)

In the example of the tris game, the cset is defined in [file _tris.ol_](https://github.com/jolie/examples/blob/master/v1.10.x/02_basics/5_sessions/tris/tris.ol) as it follows:

```jolie
cset {
    token: MoveRequest.game_token
}
```

where _MoveRequest_ is a message type related to operation _move_ defined in the interface _TrisGameInterface_.

```jolie
 type MoveRequest: void {
    .game_token: string
    .participant_token: string
    .place: int
}
```

It is worth noting that the correlation variable is named _token_ but it can be found in node _game\_token_ within the type _MoveRequest_. 

Let us now commenting the behavioural part of the example: a game is started by means of operation _startGame_ sent from a user to the tris service. If the startGame message does not contain any token, a new game token is generated by means of the primitive _new_ together a a specific token for each participant, that which plays with circles and that which plays with crosses.

```jolie
token = new;
...
global.games.( token ).circle_participant = new;
...
global.games.( token ).cross_participant = new;
```

All these token are stored into an hashmap at the level of a global variable. The circle and the game token are returned to the caller which starts to wait for a contender. When a second user calls the operation _startGame_ by specifying a game token of an existing pending game \(retrieved thanks to the operation _listOpenGames_\), the game can be initiated and the second user receives the token for playing with the cross and the game token. At this point, the server calls itself on the operation _initiateGame_ sending all the tokens.

The session started by the invocation of operation _iniateGame_ is actually the game session to which the players must send their moves. Indeed, the fist action performed by such a session is the initialization of the correlation variable _token_ with the actual token of the game:

```jolie
csets.token = request.game_token;
```

Finally a loop is started for managing the right moves from the players. Each of them receives the actual status of the game on the operation _syncPlaces_ and they will send their moves using the operation _move_. As we shown before, the message of operation _move_ contains the node _game\_token_ which brings the actual token to be correlated with the variable _token_.

## The primitive `new`

Jolie provides the primitive `new` which returns a _fresh_ value to a correlation variable. `new` guarantees to return a value never returned by one of its previous calls. Its usage is very simple, it is sufficient to assign a variable with the value _new_:

```jolie
x = new
```

## Correlation sets syntax

Correlation sets are declared in the deployment part of a program using the following syntax:

```jolie
cset {
    correlationVariable_1: alias_11 alias_12, ...
    correlationVariable_2: alias_21 alias_22, ... 
}
```

The fact that correlation aliases are defined on message types makes correlation definitions statically strongly typed. A static checker verifies that each alias points to a node that will surely be present in every incoming message of the referenced type; technically, this means that the node itself and all its ancestors nodes are not optional in the type.

For services using `sequential` or `concurrent` execution modalities, for each operation used in an input statement in the behaviour there is exactly one correlation set that links all its variables to the type of the operation. Since there is _exactly one_ correlation set referring to an operation, we can unambiguously call it the correlation set for the operation.

Whenever a service receives a message through an input port \(and the message is correctly typed with relation to the port's interface\) there are three possibilities, defined below.

* The message correlates with a behaviour instance. In this case the message is received and given to the behaviour instance, which will be able to consume it through an input statement for the related operation of the message.
* The message does not correlate with any behaviour instance and its operation is a starting operation in the behavioural definition. In this case, a new behaviour instance is created and the message is assigned to it. If the starting operation has an associated correlation set, all the correlation variables in the correlation set are atomically assigned \(from the values of the aliases in the message\) to the behaviour instance before starting its executing.
* The message does not correlate with any behaviour instance and its operation is not a starting operation in the behavioural definition. In this case, the message is rejected and a `CorrelationError` fault is sent back to the invoker.

## Another correlation set example

Let us consider an example in which a server prints at console concurrent messages coming from different clients. The complete code can be found [here](https://github.com/jolie/examples/tree/master/v1.10.x/02_basics/5_sessions/login). Each time a client logs in, the server instantiates a unique `sid`, by means of the `new` function. To request any other operation \(`print` or `logout`\), each client must send its own `sid` in order to identify its session with the server.

```jolie
type LoginRequest {
	name: string
}

type Message {
	sid: string
	message?: string
}

interface PrinterInterface {
	RequestResponse: login( LoginRequest )( Message )
	OneWay: print( Message ), logout( Message )
}
```

The interface file contains the declaration of operations and data types. Since the `sid` subtype \(`OpMessage.sid`\) will be used as a variable of the correlation set, it is defined as a non-optional subtype \(defaulted to `[1,1]`\) and must be present in any message sent and received by all correlated operations.

```jolie
//printer.ol

from PrinterInterface import PrinterInterface
from PrinterInterface import Message	// we need to import also type Message to be used in the cset
from console import Console

service Printer {

	/* here we define the correlation set we will use for correlating messages inside the same session */
	cset {
		/* sid is the variable used inside the session to identify the correlation set.
	   	The values which come from messages whose type is OpMessage and the node is .sid will be stored
	   	inside variable sid as identification key */
		sid: Message.sid
	}


	embed Console as Console 

	execution: concurrent 

	inputPort PrintService {
		location: "socket://localhost:2000"
		protocol: sodep
		interfaces: PrinterInterface
	}

	init {
		keepRunning = true
	}

	main
	{
		/* here the session starts with the login operation  */
		login( request )( response ){
			username = request.name
			/* here we generate a fresh token for correlation set sid */
			response.sid = csets.sid = new
			response.message = "You are logged in."
		}
		while( keepRunning ){
			/* both print and logout operations receives message of type OpMessage,
			thus they can be correlated on sid node */
			[ print( request ) ]{
				println@Console( "User "+username+" writes: "+request.message )()
			}
			[ logout( request ) ] {
				println@Console("User "+username+" logged out.")();
				keepRunning = false }
		}
	}
}
```

`cset` is the scope containing correlation variable declarations. A correlation variable declaration links a list of aliases. A correlation alias is a path \(using the same syntax for variable paths\) starting with a message type name, indicating where the value for comparing the correlation variable can be retrieved within the message.

In our example the correlation variable `sid` is linked to the alias `Message.sid`.

In scope main, the `csets` prefix is used to assign a value to the correlation variable `sid`. The same value is assigned to `response.sid` \(via chained assignment\), which is passed as a response to the client.

```jolie
//client.ol

from PrinterInterface import PrinterInterface
from console import Console
from console import ConsoleInputInterface


service Client {

	embed Console as Console 

	inputPort ConsoleInputPort {
	  location: "local"
	  interfaces: ConsoleInputInterface
	}

	outputPort PrintService {
		location: "socket://localhost:2000"
		protocol: sodep
		interfaces: PrinterInterface
	}

	init {
		registerForInput@Console()()
	}

	main
	{
		print@Console( "Insert your name: " )()
		in( request.name )
		keepRunning = true
		login@PrintService( request )( response )
		opMessage.sid = response.sid
		println@Console( "Server Responded: " + response.message + "\t sid: "+opMessage.sid )()
		while( keepRunning ){
			print@Console( "Insert a message or type \"logout\" for logging out > " )()
			in(  opMessage.message )
			if( opMessage.message != "logout" ){
				print@PrintService( opMessage )
			} else {
				logout@PrintService( opMessage )
				keepRunning = false
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Finally, in its scope main, the client assigns the `sid` value to its variable `opMessage.sid`. It will be used in any other message sent to the server to correlate client's messages to its session on the server.

## Correlation variables and aliases

So far we have shown how a correlation variable can be related to a one single subnode of a type, but generally there could be more messages which can contain a value to be correlated. We say there could be more _aliases_ for the same correlation variable. Aliases ensure loose coupling between the names of the correlation variables and the data structures of incoming messages.

Let us consider the following scenario: a chat server allows its users to log in and choose the channel \(identified by an integer\) they want to join. Once subscribed into a channel a user can send a message, log out from the server or switch channel, by sending another subscription request.

Such a scenario can be modelled by means of four message type definitions \(one for each operation\), as shown in the snippet below:

```jolie
// inteface.ol

type LoginType: void {
    .name: string
}

type SubscriptionType: void {
    .channel: int
    .sid: string
}

type MessageType: void {
    .message: string
    .sid: string
}

type LogType: void {
    .sid: string
}

interface ChatInterface {
    RequestResponse: 
        login( LoginType )( LogType )
    OneWay: 
        subscribe( SubscriptionType ), 
        sendMessage( MessageType ), 
        logout( LogType )
}

// server.ol

cset {
    sid: SubscriptionType.sid
         MessageType.sid
         LogType.sid
}
```

It is worth noting that the correlation variable `sid` is linked to aliases `SubscriptionType.sid`, `MessageType.sid`, `LogType.sid`. Each time the server will receive a correlated-operation request, it will correlate any client to its corresponding session by checking the aliased value of `sid`.

## Multiple correlation sets

Multiple correlation sets can be used in order to manage distributed scenarios. In the [authentication example](https://github.com/jolie/examples/tree/master/v1.10.x/02_basics/5_sessions/authentication) we model the case of an application which delegates the authentication phase to an external _identity provider_.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/authentication.png)

The sequence chart https://github.com/jolie/examples/tree/master/v1.10.x/02_basics/5_sessions/authenticationof the exchanged messages follows:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/auth_sequence_chart.svg)

First of all the _user_ call the _application_ for requesting a login and it is redirected to the _identity provider_. Before replying to the user, the _application_ opens an authentication session on the identity provider \(calling the operation _openAuthentication_\) which returns a correlation identifier called _auth\_token_. The _auth\_token_ is sent also to the user. At this point, the user can sends its credential to the _identity\_provider_ together with the _auth\_token_ in order to be authenticated. If the authentication has success, the _identity\_provider_ sends a success to the _application_, a _failure_ otherwise. Finally, the user can check if it has access to the application calling the operation _getResult_, together with the _session\_id_, on the _application_. The _session\_id_ is generated by the _application_ after receiving the reply from the _identity\_provider_.

It is worth noting that the in the application we define two correlation sets:

```jolie
cset {
  auth_token: OpenAuthenticationResponse.auth_token
              AuthenticationResult.auth_token
}

cset {
  session_id: GetResultRequest.session_id
              PrintMessageRequest.session_id
              ExitApplicationRequest.session_id
}
```

The former permits to identify the session thanks to _auth\_token_ whereas the latter exploits the _session\_id_. Both of them identify the same session, but the token _auth\_token_ is used for identifying the messages related to the _identity\_provider_ whereas the _session\_id_ it is used for identifying the session initiated by the user into the application. Once logged indeed, the _auth\_token_ is not used anymore, whereas the _session\_id_ can be used by the user for accessing the application. It is worth noting that, after the reception of a success or a failure by the application, the _auth\_token_ is still available as a variable inside the session. But, since there are no more operations correlated with it in the behaviour \(only the operations _getResult_, _printMessage_ and _exitApplication_ can be used\), it is not possible that the _auth\_token_ can be used again for correlating the session.

## The provide-until statement

The `provide` `until` statement eases defining workflows where a microservice _provides_ access to a set of resources _until_ some event happened. Such a statement is useful in combination with correlation sets, because it allows for accessing a specific subset of operations once a session is established.

The syntax is

```jolie
provide
  [ IS_1 ] { branch_code_1 }
  [ IS_i ] { branch_code_i }
  [ IS_n ] { branch_code_n }
until
  [ IS_m ] { branch_code_m }
  [ IS_j ] { branch_code_j }
  [ IS_k ] { branch_code_k }
```

The inputs `IS_1, ..., IS_n` will be continuously available until one of the operations under the `until` \(`IS_m, ..., IS_k`\) is called.

In the authentication example described in the previous section, the application exploits a `provide` `until` for providing the operation _printMessage_ to the final user, until she sends the exiting operation _exitApplication_:

```jolie
provide
   [ printMessage( print_request ) ] {
       println@Console("Message to print:" + print_request.message )()
   }
 until
   [ exitApplication( request ) ] {
       println@Console("Exiting from session " + request.session_id )()
   }
```

## Sessions and Jolie libraries

Managing session-related calls impacts also on the libraries used by a Jolie program (after all, they are microservices too!).
Sometimes it is useful to have a library "call back" its client, e.g., if executing some batch work or waiting for the user's input, for which we do not want to use a request-response pattern, but a one-way: the client enables the reception of some inputs from the library, which then will send a notification to the client each time a new input is ready. 

A concrete example of that is operation `in` of the Console service, which, as seen in the [example section on communication ports](communication-primitives.html), receives inputs from the standard input.

While calling that operation on a single-session service does not pose any problem on where to route the incoming request, that is not the case for the `concurrent` and `sequential` execution modalities, where many instances can prompt the insertion of some data to the user.

To correctly route input messages to the appropriate session, the Console service puts in place the operation `subscribeSessionListener` (and its complementary `unsubscribeSessionListener`). That operation is useful to signal to the Console service that it should "tag" with a token given by the user (more on this in the next paragraph) the input received from the standard input, so that incoming input messages can be correctly correlated with their related session. 

Technically, to support that functionality, we need to define a cset targeting the node `InRequest.token` (visible at the beginning of the code below) and to enable the tagging of input messages by the Console API, calling the operation `registerForInput` with a request containing the `enableSessionListener` node set to `true`. Then, to receive some message from the standard input (e.g., `in( message )`) we:
- define this session's token (e.g., we define a variable `token` assigning to it a unique value with the `new` primitive);
- subscribe our listener with this session's token (`subscribeSessionListener@Console( { token = token } )()`);
- wait for the data from the prompt (e.g., `in( message )`);

Finally, when we terminated this session's inputs, we can unsubscribe our listener for this session (`unsubscribeSessionListener@Console( { token = token } )()`);

For a more comprehensive example, we report the code below.

```jolie
// we define a cset on the InRequest.token node
cset {
  sessionToken: InRequest.token
}

//[...]

main
{
  test()( res ){
    // we registerForInput, enabling sessionListeners
    registerForInput@Console( { enableSessionListener = true } )()
    // we define this session's token
    token = new
    // we set the sessionToken for the InRequest
    csets.sessionToken = token
    // we subscribe our listener with this session's token
    subscribeSessionListener@Console( { token = token } )()
    // we make sure the print out to the user and the request for input are atomic
    synchronized( inputSession ) {
      println@Console( "insert response data for session " + token + ":" )()
      // we wait for the data from the prompt
      in( res )
    }
    // we unsubscribe our listener for this session before closing
    unsubscribeSessionListener@Console( { token = token } )()
  }
}
```
