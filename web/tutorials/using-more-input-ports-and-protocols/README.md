# Using more input ports and protocols

In this tutorial we will show how to add more input ports in a service. In such a way, it is possible to enable the service to receive messages with different formats and protocols by expoliting the same behaviour.
In particular, we modify the service `AdvancedCalculatorService` of the tutorial [Using more than one dependency](https://docs.jolie-lang.org/v1.10.x/tutorials/using-more-than-one-dependency/) as depicted in the following diagram:

Besides the existing port for protocol `http`, Input ports will be incrementally added for the following protocols:

- [soap](soap.html)
- [sodep](sodep.html)
- [https](https.html)
- [soaps](soaps.html)
- [sodeps](sodeps.html)
