# Introduction

Welcome to the reference documentation for the [Jolie programming language](https://jolie-lang.org).

## What is Jolie?

Jolie is a _microservice-oriented programming language_: it is designed to reason effectively about the key questions of microservice development, including the following.

* What are the APIs exposed by services?
* How can these APIs be accessed?
* How are APIs implemented in terms of concurrency, communication, and computation?

## How does it look?

This is a simple service for greeting clients.

```text
execution { concurrent } // Handle clients concurrently

// Some data types
type GreetRequest { name:string }
type GreetResponse { greeting:string }

// Define the API that we are going to publish
interface GreeterAPI {
RequestResponse: greet( GreetRequest )( GreetResponse )
}

// An input port publishes APIs to clients
inputPort GreeterInput {
location: "socket://localhost:8080"        // Use TCP/IP
protocol: http { format = "json" }        // Use HTTP
interfaces: GreeterAPI                    // Publish GreeterAPI
}

// Implementation (the behaviour)
main
{
    /*
    This statement receives a request for greet,
    runs the code in { ... }, and sends response
    back to the client.
    */
    greet( request )( response ) {
        response.greeting = "Hello, " + request.name
    }
}
```

If you have installed Jolie \([get it here](https://www.jolie-lang.org/downloads.html)\), you can save the code above in a file called `greeter.ol` and then launch it from the terminal with the command:

```text
jolie greeter.ol
```

The service is now waiting for client requests. Run

```text
curl http://localhost:8080/greet?name=Jolie
```

and you will see the output

```javascript
{"greeting":"Hello, Jolie"}
```

## Microservice-orientation

More in general, Jolie brings a structured linguistic approach to the programming of services, including constructs for access endpoints \([communication ports](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/71815c98562e34135ed81b0c11eb00ff70523567/introduction/basics/communication-ports/README.md)\), APIs with synchronous and asynchronous operations \([interfaces](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/71815c98562e34135ed81b0c11eb00ff70523567/introduction/basics/interfaces/README.md)\), [communications](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/71815c98562e34135ed81b0c11eb00ff70523567/introduction/basics/communication-ports/using_communication_ports.md), behavioural workflows \(including a native [parallel operator](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/71815c98562e34135ed81b0c11eb00ff70523567/introduction/basics/composing_statements.md)\), and multiparty sessions \([correlation sets](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/71815c98562e34135ed81b0c11eb00ff70523567/introduction/basics/sessions.md)\). Additionally, Jolie embraces that microservice systems are often heterogeneous and interoperability should be a first-class citizen: all data in Jolie is structured as trees that can be semi-automatically \(most of the time fully automatically\) converted from/to different data formats \(JSON, XML, etc.\) and communicated over a variety of protocols \(HTTP, binary protocols, etc.\). Jolie is an attempt at making the _first language for microservices_, in the sense that it provides primitives to deal directly with the programming of common concerns regarding microservices without relying on frameworks or external libraries. Our aim is to provide a tool that aid developers in producing and managing microservice systems more effectively.
